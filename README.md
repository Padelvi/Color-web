## Color-web

This web application has the simple purpose of converting between hex, rgb and rgba color formats.

It is a simple app built in flask.

### Installation

I reccomend you to use docker for the installation.

Copy this repo and use this command:

`
docker compose up -d
`

It will do all the installation process.
